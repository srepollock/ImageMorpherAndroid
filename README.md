# MorphingProject-4932
Morphing project for COMP4932
---
This is my morphing android application. This will take two images and morph (or change) the first image into the second image.

This is a project completed for my COMP4932 class.
---

#To Do:
-------
- Lines redrawing the first after editing (fix this) ((not too bad))
- Create a line class
    - This should hold onto the vector (direction & magnitude)
- Setup new activity for once morph is done
    - scroll bar
    - image view
    - play slideshow
