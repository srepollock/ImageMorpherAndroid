# MorphingProject-4932
Morphing project for COMP4932
---
This is my morphing android application. This will take two images and morph (or change) the first image into the second image.

This is a project completed for my COMP4932 class.

#To Do:
-------
- Fix intermediate frames. Something is wrong with logic
- Special case for frames
    - entering 0 will show the last frames and will display without calculating
        - will have to store the previous number somewhere ??

#Errors:
--------
- Something is wrong with my images when I do multiple frames. Check where I get the start and end points in the funciton
- Cross dissolving should be finished and working
