# MorphingProject-4932
Morphing project for COMP4932

#To Do:
-------
- Drawing lines
    - Editable lines
    - Link lines in a list
- Create a line class
    - This should hold onto the vector (direction & magnitude)
- Setup new activity for once morph is done
    - scroll bar
    - image view
    - play slideshow
    
#Thoughts
---------
- What should I do to draw the lines?
    - How should it work?
        - Possibly call the onDraw for both canvases at the same time?
        - Same touchListener for both canvases?
